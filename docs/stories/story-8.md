# Story 8: Smart File Management and Integration - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want converted files to be automatically saved to the appropriate location and easily accessible,
So that I can find and use my documents efficiently without manual file organization.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Conversion engine from Story 7, Epic 1 scanner document storage, device gallery and file system
- Technology: Flutter file system APIs, device gallery integration, existing Supabase storage patterns
- Follows pattern: Existing file storage and organization from scanner workflow
- Touch points: File selection interface, Supabase document storage, device gallery access, sharing functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Smart saving logic automatically routes PDFs to Files section and images (JPEG/PNG) to device Gallery
2. File selection interface allows choosing from gallery, files, and previously scanned documents from Epic 1
3. Integration with Epic 1 scanner output provides seamless access to scanned documents for conversion

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing scanner document storage and organization continue unchanged
5. New file management follows existing Supabase storage patterns and user association
6. Integration with device file system maintains proper permissions and access patterns

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Conversion history provides chronological tracking of all file conversions with original/converted file links
8. Share functionality enables easy distribution of converted documents through standard device sharing
9. Duplicate detection identifies and helps resolve potential file naming conflicts

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing file storage patterns, integrate with device file system APIs, maintain Supabase consistency
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow file organization from scanner storage, permission handling from camera/gallery access
- **Key Constraints:** Platform-specific file system differences, permission requirements, storage organization consistency

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Smart saving routes files to appropriate locations (PDFs→Files, Images→Gallery)
- [ ] File selection from gallery, files, and scanner documents working
- [ ] Epic 1 scanner integration provides seamless document access
- [ ] Conversion history tracking implemented
- [ ] Share functionality for converted documents working
- [ ] Duplicate detection and resolution interface complete
- [ ] Existing scanner storage system unchanged
- [ ] File system permissions handled gracefully

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** File permission complexities preventing proper file system access on different platforms
- **Mitigation:** Progressive permission requests, clear user guidance, fallback file handling methods
- **Rollback:** Disable smart file management, maintain basic conversion with manual save functionality

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing scanner/storage APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (conversion history table)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing file handling patterns
- [ ] File system access respects platform-specific guidelines
