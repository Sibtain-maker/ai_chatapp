# Story 3: Handwriting to Text Conversion - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want my handwritten notes converted to searchable typed text,
So that I can organize, search, and study from my notes digitally without manual retyping.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: AI-enhanced document from Story 2, Supabase database for text storage
- Technology: OCR processing library, Flutter text editing widgets, existing document metadata system
- Follows pattern: Existing document processing pipeline, text data storage patterns
- Touch points: Post-enhancement processing, document metadata updates, text export functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. OCR conversion achieves >90% accuracy across different handwriting styles (cursive, print, mixed)
2. Text conversion preserves original formatting (bullet points, lists, paragraphs, spacing)
3. Edit functionality allows correction of OCR recognition errors with intuitive interface

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing AI enhancement workflow continues to work unchanged
5. New OCR processing follows existing document processing patterns
6. Integration with Supabase maintains document-text relationship consistency

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Processing completes in <5 seconds per page
8. Export options integrate with existing sharing patterns
9. No regression in camera capture or AI enhancement functionality

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Add OCR step after AI enhancement, extend document model for text data
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow document processing pipeline established in Stories 1-2
- **Key Constraints:** 90% accuracy requirement, 5-second processing limit, preserve formatting structure

## Definition of Done
- [ ] OCR accuracy >90% across handwriting styles
- [ ] Formatting preservation (bullets, lists, paragraphs)
- [ ] Text editing interface for error correction
- [ ] Processing time <5 seconds per page
- [ ] Export functionality implemented
- [ ] Existing enhancement workflow verified
- [ ] Supabase text storage integration complete

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** OCR accuracy falling below 90% requirement for various handwriting styles
- **Mitigation:** Implement multiple OCR engines with fallback, comprehensive user correction interface
- **Rollback:** Disable OCR step, maintain AI enhancement without text conversion feature

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (text data fields)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact meets <5 second processing requirement
