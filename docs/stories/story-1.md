# Story 1: Camera Integration and Basic Scanning - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want to capture documents using my phone's camera,
So that I can digitize my notes and handouts efficiently without needing external scanning equipment.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Dashboard scanner feature card, GoRouter navigation system
- Technology: Flutter camera plugin, Riverpod state management, Supabase storage
- Follows pattern: Existing feature card navigation (similar to other dashboard features)
- Touch points: Dashboard feature card tap, user authentication state, document storage bucket

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Camera opens immediately when scanner feature card is tapped from dashboard
2. Automatic edge detection identifies document boundaries in real-time viewfinder
3. Perspective correction automatically straightens angled document photos

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing dashboard navigation continues to work unchanged
5. New camera functionality follows existing feature card navigation pattern
6. Integration with Supabase storage maintains current authentication flow

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Camera permissions handled gracefully with user-friendly prompts
8. Camera functionality tested on iOS and Android platforms
9. No regression in existing dashboard or authentication functionality

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Add camera route to existing GoRouter setup, integrate with dashboard feature card navigation
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow same navigation pattern as other feature cards (Edit, Convert, Ask AI)
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle camera permissions, device compatibility, and graceful fallbacks

## Definition of Done
- [x] Camera opens from scanner feature card
- [x] Edge detection works in real-time
- [x] Perspective correction applied automatically
- [x] Save functionality stores to Supabase
- [x] Existing dashboard functionality verified
- [x] Camera permissions handled properly
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility confirmed

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Camera permission denial blocking core functionality
- **Mitigation:** Implement graceful permission handling with fallback to gallery selection
- **Rollback:** Remove camera route, revert feature card to placeholder state

## Compatibility Verification
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes are additive only (new documents table)
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [x] Performance impact is negligible

## Dev Agent Record
