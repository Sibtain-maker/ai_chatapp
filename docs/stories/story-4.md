# Story 4: Timetable Scanning and Auto-Setup - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want to scan my printed timetable and have it automatically converted into a digital schedule,
So that I don't have to manually enter all my class information and can avoid scheduling errors.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Scanner functionality from Epic 1, Supabase database for schedule storage
- Technology: OCR processing from scanner, Flutter schedule widgets, existing Riverpod providers
- Follows pattern: Existing document processing pipeline (camera → AI enhancement → OCR)
- Touch points: Dashboard schedule feature card, scanner OCR output, schedule data storage

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Scan university timetable using existing camera functionality or gallery image selection
2. Extract class information with >95% accuracy: course name, time, room, professor
3. Handle various timetable formats and layouts (grid, list, table formats)

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing scanner workflow continues unchanged (camera → enhancement → OCR)
5. New timetable parsing follows existing OCR processing patterns
6. Integration with Supabase maintains data consistency with user authentication

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Manual editing interface allows correction of parsed schedule data
8. Conflict detection identifies overlapping classes automatically
9. No regression in existing scanner or dashboard functionality

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing OCR pipeline with timetable-specific parsing logic
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow document processing pipeline from Stories 1-3, extend OCR results processing
- **Key Constraints:** >95% parsing accuracy, handle multiple university timetable formats, preserve scanner functionality

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Timetable scanning uses existing camera/gallery functionality
- [ ] >95% accuracy in schedule data extraction
- [ ] Multiple timetable formats supported
- [ ] Manual editing interface implemented
- [ ] Conflict detection working
- [ ] Existing scanner functionality verified
- [ ] Supabase schedule storage complete

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Parsing accuracy below 95% due to varied university timetable formats
- **Mitigation:** Multiple parsing algorithms, format learning capability, comprehensive manual correction interface
- **Rollback:** Disable timetable parsing, maintain basic scanner functionality

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing scanner APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (new schedule tables)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material Design 3 patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (parsing done efficiently)
