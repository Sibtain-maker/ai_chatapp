# Story 10: Image Analysis and Document Integration - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want to upload images of documents, diagrams, or homework to the AI chat,
So that I can get specific help analyzing and understanding visual academic content without retyping or describing it.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: AI chat interface from Story 9, Epic 1 scanner document storage, existing image handling from camera/gallery
- Technology: Vision API for image analysis, existing Flutter image handling, document storage integration from scanner
- Follows pattern: Existing image processing workflows from scanner (camera → enhancement → storage)
- Touch points: Chat interface image upload, scanner document library, AI processing pipeline, document analysis storage

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Image upload functionality seamlessly integrated within chat interface with intuitive attachment options
2. Analysis of diverse academic content including documents, diagrams, equations, and homework assignments
3. Integration with Epic 1 scanned documents allows direct analysis of previously captured materials

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing chat interface and scanner document storage continue unchanged
5. New image analysis follows existing AI processing patterns from chat responses and scanner enhancement
6. Integration with Supabase maintains consistent document relationships and user data organization

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Context-aware responses provide specific analysis based on uploaded image content and academic context
8. Support for handwriting analysis leverages existing OCR capabilities from Epic 1 for enhanced understanding
9. Multiple image format support (JPEG, PNG, PDF pages) maintains compatibility with scanner and converter outputs

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Extend chat interface with image upload, connect to scanner document library, integrate Vision API with existing AI service
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow image processing patterns from scanner pipeline, AI processing from chat responses
- **Key Constraints:** Academic content accuracy, handwriting analysis integration, multi-format support

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Image upload functionality integrated in chat interface
- [ ] Academic content analysis working (documents, diagrams, equations, homework)
- [ ] Epic 1 scanner document integration functional
- [ ] Context-aware responses based on image content
- [ ] Handwriting analysis leveraging existing OCR capabilities
- [ ] Multi-format support (JPEG, PNG, PDF pages) implemented
- [ ] Clear error feedback when analysis fails
- [ ] Existing chat and scanner systems unchanged

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Image analysis reliability issues with complex academic diagrams and handwriting
- **Mitigation:** Multiple analysis attempts, integration with existing OCR from Epic 1, user correction interface
- **Rollback:** Disable image analysis, maintain text-only chat functionality

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing chat/scanner APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (document analysis table)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing image handling patterns
- [ ] Performance maintains chat response time requirements
