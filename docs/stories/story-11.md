# Story 11: Cross-Feature AI Integration - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want the AI to understand my scanned documents and class schedule,
So that it can provide personalized academic assistance and intelligent reminders based on my complete academic context.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: AI chat from Stories 9-10, Epic 1 scanner document library, Epic 2 schedule data, Epic 3 converted files
- Technology: Context retrieval system, existing Supabase document/schedule storage, AI service integration for cross-referencing
- Follows pattern: Existing data access patterns from scanner, schedule, and converter features
- Touch points: All user document storage, schedule database, notification system, AI processing pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Access to user's complete scanned document library provides AI with full academic content context for intelligent responses
2. Schedule-aware responses integrate class timing, course information, and upcoming academic events into AI assistance
3. Document summarization and analysis capabilities leverage existing OCR and enhancement from Epic 1

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing scanner, schedule, and converter functionality continue unchanged with no performance impact
5. New AI context retrieval follows existing data access patterns from dashboard and feature integrations
6. Integration maintains Supabase data consistency across all user documents, schedules, and chat history

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Intelligent suggestions based on user's academic content provide proactive assistance tailored to individual study materials
8. Cross-reference capabilities connect information between documents and schedule for comprehensive academic support
9. Proactive academic assistance leverages schedule data to provide timely reminders and preparation suggestions

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Create context retrieval layer accessing all existing user data, extend AI service with cross-feature awareness
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow data access patterns from dashboard aggregation, permission handling from existing features
- **Key Constraints:** Data privacy and security, cross-feature consistency, intelligent context relevance

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete scanned document library access for AI context
- [ ] Schedule-aware responses and intelligent reminders implemented
- [ ] Document summarization leveraging existing OCR capabilities
- [ ] Intelligent suggestions based on user's academic content working
- [ ] Cross-reference capabilities between documents and schedule functional
- [ ] Proactive academic assistance based on upcoming classes implemented
- [ ] All existing features (scanner, schedule, converter) unchanged
- [ ] Data consistency across all user information maintained

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Data privacy concerns with AI accessing comprehensive user academic information
- **Mitigation:** Clear privacy controls, data access transparency, user permission granularity for AI features
- **Rollback:** Disable cross-feature integration, maintain isolated AI chat functionality

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing feature APIs (scanner, schedule, converter)
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (AI context tracking)
- [ ] User privacy and data security maintained across integrations
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal with efficient context retrieval
