# Story 5: Smart Class Notifications - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want to receive reliable notifications before my classes start,
So that I never miss a class or arrive late regardless of whether the app is open or closed.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Schedule data from Story 4, existing user authentication system
- Technology: Flutter local notifications, background processing, existing Riverpod state management
- Follows pattern: Existing async operations and user preference handling
- Touch points: Schedule data storage, notification permissions, device notification system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Reliable notifications work across all app states (foreground, background, closed, device locked)
2. Customizable notification timing options (5, 10, 15, 30 minutes before class)
3. Rich notifications display class details (course name, room number, professor name)

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing schedule data structure continues unchanged
5. New notification system follows existing permission handling patterns
6. Integration with device settings respects do-not-disturb modes

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Notification persistence verified through comprehensive testing scenarios
8. Cross-platform reliability tested on both iOS and Android
9. No impact on existing app functionality or performance

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Add notification scheduling layer on top of existing schedule data
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow permission handling patterns from camera/gallery access
- **Key Constraints:** Cross-platform notification reliability, background execution limits, battery optimization

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Notifications work in all app states (background, closed, locked)
- [ ] Customizable timing preferences implemented
- [ ] Rich notification content displays class information
- [ ] Do-not-disturb integration respects device settings
- [ ] Cross-platform reliability verified (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Existing schedule functionality unchanged
- [ ] Notification permissions handled gracefully

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Cross-platform notification reliability issues on different OS versions
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing matrix, fallback notification methods, user troubleshooting guidance
- **Rollback:** Disable notification scheduling, maintain schedule viewing functionality

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing schedule APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (notification preferences table)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Battery optimization considerations implemented
