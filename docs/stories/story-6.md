# Story 6: Schedule Management and Calendar Integration - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want to view and manage my class schedule and sync it with my phone's calendar,
So that all my commitments are organized in one place and accessible across all my devices.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Schedule data from Story 4, notification system from Story 5, device calendar APIs
- Technology: Flutter calendar widgets, platform-specific calendar integration (iOS EventKit, Android CalendarContract)
- Follows pattern: Existing data management and UI patterns from dashboard
- Touch points: Schedule database, device calendar permissions, export/import functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Clean schedule interface showing daily and weekly class layouts with intuitive navigation
2. Edit schedule details functionality (time, room, professor, course name)
3. Export schedule to device calendar (iOS Calendar, Google Calendar) with proper event formatting

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing schedule data structure and notifications continue unchanged
5. New calendar integration follows existing permission handling patterns
6. Integration with device calendar maintains data consistency

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Import capability from device calendar for additional events (assignments, meetings)
8. Schedule conflict resolution interface identifies and helps resolve timing overlaps
9. Semester/term management allows switching between different academic periods

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Add calendar management layer on top of existing schedule and notification systems
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow permission and data management patterns from authentication and scanner features
- **Key Constraints:** Platform-specific calendar APIs, data synchronization, conflict resolution logic

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Daily and weekly schedule views implemented
- [ ] Schedule editing functionality working
- [ ] Export to device calendar functional (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Import from device calendar implemented
- [ ] Conflict resolution interface complete
- [ ] Semester management system working
- [ ] Existing schedule and notifications unchanged
- [ ] Calendar permissions handled gracefully

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Platform-specific calendar integration complexity and permission challenges
- **Mitigation:** Graceful degradation when calendar access denied, clear user guidance, comprehensive testing
- **Rollback:** Disable calendar integration, maintain internal schedule management functionality

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing schedule/notification APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (semester/term tables)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material Design 3 patterns
- [ ] Performance remains optimal with calendar synchronization
