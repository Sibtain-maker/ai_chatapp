# Story 2: AI Document Enhancement Engine - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want blurry scanned documents to be automatically enhanced using AI,
So that I can read low-quality photos clearly for effective studying without needing to rescan.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Camera capture flow from Story 1, Supabase storage bucket
- Technology: AI image processing library, Flutter image manipulation, existing Riverpod providers
- Follows pattern: Existing document processing workflow, async operation handling
- Touch points: Post-camera capture processing, document storage pipeline, user progress feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. AI enhancement automatically processes captured documents in <3 seconds
2. Before/after preview shows enhancement results with toggle comparison
3. Enhancement works on various document types (handwritten notes, textbooks, printed handouts)

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing camera capture workflow continues unchanged
5. New AI processing follows existing async operation patterns
6. Integration with Supabase storage maintains document metadata consistency

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Processing progress indicator provides clear user feedback
8. Enhancement quality comparable to professional scanner output
9. No regression in camera capture or document save functionality

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Insert AI processing step between camera capture and storage, use existing async patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow async operation handling similar to authentication flows
- **Key Constraints:** 3-second processing limit, maintain image quality, handle processing failures gracefully

## Definition of Done
- [ ] AI enhancement processes documents <3 seconds
- [ ] Before/after preview functionality working
- [ ] Enhancement quality meets professional standards
- [ ] Progress indicator provides user feedback
- [ ] Existing camera workflow verified unchanged
- [ ] Supabase storage integration maintained
- [ ] Processing error handling implemented

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** AI processing performance exceeding 3-second requirement
- **Mitigation:** Implement hybrid local/cloud processing with progressive enhancement
- **Rollback:** Disable AI processing step, revert to direct camera-to-storage flow

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (document enhancement metadata)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact meets <3 second requirement
