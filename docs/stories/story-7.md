# Story 7: Core Format Conversion Engine - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want to convert documents between PDF, JPEG, and PNG formats,
So that I can share academic materials in the appropriate format required for different platforms and submissions.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Document scanner output from Epic 1, Supabase storage system, file selection system
- Technology: Flutter PDF processing libraries, image conversion utilities, existing Riverpod state management
- Follows pattern: Existing document processing pipeline (similar to AI enhancement workflow)
- Touch points: Dashboard converter feature card, scanner document output, device file system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Complete conversion matrix supports all format combinations: PDF→JPEG, PDF→PNG, JPEG→PDF, JPEG→PNG, PNG→PDF, PNG→JPEG
2. Quality preservation maintains document clarity with no degradation during conversion process
3. Processing completes in <10 seconds for typical university document sizes (up to 10MB)

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing scanner workflow and document storage continue unchanged
5. New conversion engine follows existing async processing patterns from AI enhancement
6. Integration with Supabase storage maintains consistent file organization and user association

**Quality Requirements:**
7. File size optimization produces reasonable output sizes without quality loss
8. Error handling provides clear feedback and resolution guidance for failed conversions
9. Support for both single document and batch conversion operations

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Add conversion processing layer parallel to existing document pipeline, reuse file handling patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow async operation patterns from AI enhancement (Story 2), file handling from scanner storage
- **Key Constraints:** <10 second processing limit, quality preservation requirements, cross-platform compatibility

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 6 conversion combinations working reliably
- [ ] Quality preservation verified across format types
- [ ] Processing time <10 seconds for typical documents
- [ ] File size optimization implemented
- [ ] Error handling with clear user feedback
- [ ] Batch conversion functionality working
- [ ] Existing scanner and storage systems unchanged
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Conversion quality degradation reducing document readability
- **Mitigation:** Multiple conversion algorithms, quality validation checks, user preview before final conversion
- **Rollback:** Disable conversion processing, maintain file selection and viewing functionality

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing scanner/storage APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (conversion tracking table)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material Design 3 patterns
- [ ] Performance impact meets <10 second processing requirement
