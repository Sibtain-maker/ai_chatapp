# Story 9: Core AI Chat Interface - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a university student,
I want to chat with an AI assistant about my academic work,
So that I can get immediate help with studying, assignments, and understanding complex topics without leaving the app.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Dashboard AI chat feature card, existing user authentication system, Supabase database for chat persistence
- Technology: AI API integration (OpenAI/equivalent), Flutter chat UI components, existing Riverpod state management
- Follows pattern: Existing navigation patterns from dashboard feature cards, async operation handling from AI enhancement
- Touch points: Dashboard navigation, user authentication context, chat data storage, notification system integration

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. ChatGPT-style conversational interface with intuitive message input and scrollable chat history
2. University-level academic response quality providing accurate explanations for complex topics
3. Response time consistently <5 seconds to maintain natural conversational flow

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing dashboard navigation and authentication systems continue unchanged
5. New chat functionality follows existing async processing patterns from AI enhancement workflows
6. Integration with Supabase maintains data consistency and user association for chat persistence

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Context awareness tailored specifically for student academic needs and terminology
8. Conversation persistence preserves chat history across app sessions and device restarts
9. Error handling provides graceful fallback responses when AI service is unavailable

## Technical Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Add chat feature following existing dashboard navigation, implement AI service layer parallel to existing processing services
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow async operations from AI enhancement (Story 2), navigation patterns from other feature cards
- **Key Constraints:** <5 second response time, university-level response quality, persistent conversation storage

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ChatGPT-style interface implemented with message history
- [ ] University-level response quality achieved consistently
- [ ] Response time <5 seconds maintained
- [ ] Academic context awareness demonstrated
- [ ] Conversation persistence across sessions working
- [ ] Error handling with fallback responses implemented
- [ ] Existing dashboard and auth systems unchanged
- [ ] Chat data properly stored in Supabase

## Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** AI service costs and rate limits impacting user experience
- **Mitigation:** Efficient prompt engineering, response caching, usage monitoring with user limits
- **Rollback:** Disable AI chat processing, maintain chat interface with offline messaging

## Compatibility Verification
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing navigation/auth APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (chat conversation tables)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Material Design 3 patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal with non-blocking AI processing
