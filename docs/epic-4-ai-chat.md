## Technical Integration Requirements

### Supabase Schema Additions
```sql
-- AI chat conversations
ai_conversations (id, user_id, conversation_id, created_at, updated_at)

-- Individual chat messages
chat_messages (id, conversation_id, message_type, content, image_url, 
              ai_response, response_time, created_at)

-- Document analysis results
document_analysis (id, user_id, document_id, analysis_content, 
                  analysis_type, confidence_score, created_at)
```

### Flutter Architecture Integration
- **Feature folder:** `lib/features/ai_chat/`
- **Providers:** Chat state, conversation management, AI service integration
- **Services:** AI API integration, image processing, document context
- **UI components:** Chat interface, image upload, message display

### AI Service Integration
- **Primary AI Service:** OpenAI GPT or equivalent for conversational AI
- **Image Analysis:** Vision API for document and diagram analysis
- **Context Management:** Retrieval system for user documents and schedules
- **Response Optimization:** Caching and performance optimization

---

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (auth, scanner, schedule, converter)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (additive only)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (Material Design 3, consistent navigation)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (AI processing optimized, non-blocking UI)

---

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **AI service costs and rate limits** - Could impact app economics or user experience
2. **Response quality consistency** - AI might provide inaccurate academic advice
3. **Image analysis reliability** - Complex academic diagrams might not analyze correctly

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Cost management:** Efficient prompt engineering, response caching, usage monitoring and limits
2. **Quality assurance:** Academic response validation, user feedback loops, disclaimer messaging
3. **Analysis fallback:** Multiple analysis attempts, user correction interface, graceful failure handling

### Rollback Plan
- Disable AI chat feature card from dashboard
- Preserve chat history data but disable new conversations
- Remove AI service integrations
- No impact on scanner, schedule, converter, or authentication

---

## Definition of Done
