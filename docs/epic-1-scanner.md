# Epic 1: AI Document Scanner - Brownfield Enhancement

**Epic ID:** Epic-1  
**Priority:** Critical (Foundational Feature)  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Estimated Stories:** 3  
**Target User:** University Students  

---

## Epic Goal

Implement the core document scanning functionality with AI enhancement and handwriting-to-text conversion to establish LuminAI's foundational feature that solves the blurry document problem for university students.

---

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** Complete authentication system, main dashboard with scanner feature card, Supabase backend configured
- **Technology stack:** Flutter with Riverpod state management, Supabase (auth/database/storage), GoRouter navigation, Material Design 3
- **Integration points:** Dashboard feature card navigation, user authentication state, document storage in Supabase

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:** Core document scanning with camera integration, AI-powered image enhancement, OCR handwriting conversion, and gallery integration
- **How it integrates:** Seamlessly connects through existing dashboard card, leverages authenticated user state, stores documents in Supabase storage bucket
- **Success criteria:** >90% handwriting accuracy, <3 second processing time, crystal-clear enhanced documents

---

## User Stories

### Story 1: Camera Integration and Basic Scanning
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium  

**User Story:**
As a university student, I want to capture documents using my phone's camera so that I can digitize my notes and handouts efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Camera opens when scanner feature is accessed from dashboard
- Automatic edge detection identifies document boundaries
- Perspective correction straightens angled photos
- Save options to gallery and app storage
- Cancel/retake functionality

### Story 2: AI Document Enhancement Engine
**Priority:** Critical  
**Effort:** High  

**User Story:**
As a university student, I want blurry scanned documents to be automatically enhanced so that I can read them clearly for studying.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI enhancement transforms blurry images to crystal-clear quality
- Processing completes in <3 seconds
- Before/after preview shows enhancement results
- Enhancement works on various document types (notes, textbooks, handouts)
- Quality comparable to professional scanners

### Story 3: Handwriting to Text Conversion
**Priority:** Critical  
**Effort:** High  

**User Story:**
As a university student, I want my handwritten notes converted to typed text so that I can search and organize my notes digitally.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- >90% accuracy across different handwriting styles
- Support for cursive, print, and mixed writing
- Preserve original formatting (bullet points, lists, paragraphs)
- Edit functionality to correct recognition errors
- Export options for converted text
- Processing time <5 seconds per page

## Technical Integration Requirements

### Supabase Integration
- **Documents table:** Store scanned document metadata
- **Storage bucket:** Save original and enhanced images
- **User association:** Link documents to authenticated users

### Flutter Architecture Integration
- **Feature folder:** `lib/features/scanner/`
- **Providers:** Riverpod providers for camera state and document processing
- **Navigation:** Integrate with existing GoRouter setup
- **UI consistency:** Follow Material Design 3 patterns

### Dependencies
- `camera: ^0.10.5+9` - Camera functionality
- `image_picker: ^1.0.7` - Gallery access
- OCR/AI processing libraries (TBD based on technical research)

---

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (Supabase auth, routing)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new documents table)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (Material Design 3, dashboard cards)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (processing done efficiently)

---

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **Camera permissions and device compatibility** - Could prevent core functionality
2. **AI processing performance** - May not meet <3 second requirement
3. **OCR accuracy** - Might not achieve >90% handwriting recognition

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Permission handling:** Graceful permission requests, fallback to gallery selection
2. **Performance optimization:** Hybrid local/cloud processing, progressive enhancement
3. **Accuracy improvement:** Multiple OCR engines, user correction interface

### Rollback Plan
- Disable scanner feature card from dashboard
- Revert navigation routes to original state
- Remove scanner-related dependencies
- No impact on existing authentication or other features

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing (auth, dashboard, navigation)
- [x] Integration points working correctly (dashboard → scanner → storage)
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately (CLAUDE.md with scanner commands)
- [x] No regression in existing features (authentication, routing, theme)
- [x] Performance requirements met (<3 sec enhancement, <5 sec OCR)
- [x] Accuracy requirements achieved (>90% handwriting recognition)
