# Epic 3: File Converter - Brownfield Enhancement

**Epic ID:** Epic-3  
**Priority:** Medium (Productivity Enhancement)  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Estimated Stories:** 2  
**Target User:** University Students  
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (Scanner foundation)

---

## Epic Goal

Implement seamless file format conversion capabilities that enable students to transform documents between PDF, JPEG, and PNG formats with smart saving logic and quality preservation.

---

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** Authentication system, dashboard with converter feature card, document scanning and storage from Epic 1
- **Technology stack:** Flutter with Riverpod state management, Supabase (auth/database/storage), GoRouter navigation, Material Design 3
- **Integration points:** Dashboard navigation, scanned document integration, file system access, gallery integration

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:** Multi-format conversion engine, smart saving logic, file selection from gallery/storage, conversion progress tracking
- **How it integrates:** Accesses documents from scanner output and device storage, processes conversions locally/cloud, saves to appropriate locations
- **Success criteria:** Complete conversion matrix (PDF↔JPEG↔PNG), <10 second processing, quality preservation

---

## User Stories

### Story 1: Core Format Conversion Engine
**Priority:** Critical  
**Effort:** High  

**User Story:**
As a university student, I want to convert documents between PDF, JPEG, and PNG formats so that I can share them in the appropriate format for different academic needs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete conversion matrix: PDF→JPEG, PDF→PNG, JPEG→PDF, JPEG→PNG, PNG→PDF, PNG→JPEG
- Quality preservation with no degradation in document clarity
- File size optimization for reasonable output sizes
- Processing time <10 seconds for typical document sizes
- Error handling with clear feedback and resolution guidance
- Support for both single and batch conversions

### Story 2: Smart File Management and Integration
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium  

**User Story:**
As a university student, I want converted files to be automatically saved to the right location and integrated with my existing documents so that I can easily find and use them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Smart saving logic: PDFs → Files section, images → Gallery
- File selection from gallery, files, and scanned documents
- Integration with Epic 1 scanner output
- Conversion history and file organization
- Share functionality for converted documents
- Duplicate detection and resolution

## Technical Integration Requirements

### Supabase Schema Additions
```sql
-- File conversion tracking
file_conversions (id, user_id, original_file_path, converted_file_path, 
                 original_format, target_format, file_size_before, 
                 file_size_after, processing_time, status, created_at)

-- Conversion history
conversion_history (id, user_id, conversion_id, action_type, timestamp)
```

### Flutter Architecture Integration
- **Feature folder:** `lib/features/converter/`
- **Providers:** Conversion state, file management, progress tracking
- **Services:** PDF processing, image conversion, file system management
- **UI components:** Format selection, progress indicators, file browsers

### Platform-Specific Requirements
- **File System Access:** Read/write permissions for documents and gallery
- **Format Libraries:** PDF processing, image manipulation
- **Storage Management:** Efficient local caching and cleanup

---

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (auth, scanner, dashboard)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (additive only)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (Material Design 3, consistent theming)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (conversion done efficiently without blocking UI)

---

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **File permission complexities** - Platform-specific file access restrictions
2. **Conversion quality degradation** - Format conversions might reduce document quality
3. **Processing performance** - Large files could exceed 10-second requirement

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Permission management:** Clear user guidance, fallback file selection methods, progressive permissions
2. **Quality preservation:** Multiple conversion algorithms, quality validation, user preview options
3. **Performance optimization:** File size limits, progress indicators, background processing

### Rollback Plan
- Disable converter feature card from dashboard
- Remove conversion routes and providers
- Clean up conversion tracking tables
- No impact on scanner, authentication, or other features

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified (auth, dashboard, scanner continues working)
- [x] Integration points working correctly (scanner → converter, file system access)
- [x] Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md with converter commands)
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] Complete conversion matrix working reliably
- [x] <10 second processing time achieved
- [x] Quality preservation validated across format types

---
