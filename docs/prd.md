## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Primary Goal
**User Problem Solution**: LuminAI's primary objective is solving the blurry document scanning problem for university students, enabling them to study effectively with crystal-clear digitized content.

### Background Context
University students consistently struggle with poor-quality scanned documents that hinder their academic performance. Current scanning solutions produce blurry, unreadable results that force students to either re-scan multiple times, avoid scanning altogether, or waste time manually transcribing unclear content.

### Success Metrics
- **Problem Resolution**: >90% improvement in document readability post-scanning
- **User Adoption**: Thousands of daily active university student users
- **Academic Impact**: Measurable improvement in student study efficiency
- **Feature Utilization**: High engagement across all four integrated features

### Change Log
- v1.0 (Aug 22, 2025): Initial PRD creation based on comprehensive brainstorming and project brief
