# LuminAI Project Brief

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 22, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## Executive Summary

**LuminAI** is an AI-powered document productivity mobile application designed specifically for university students. The app combines four integrated features - smart document scanning, intelligent class schedule management, seamless format conversion, and AI chat assistance - to create a comprehensive productivity toolkit for academic success.

**Core Value Proposition:** Transform blurry, unreadable scanned documents into crystal-clear, digitized content that students can actually study from, while providing integrated tools for academic productivity.

**Target Market:** University students across all academic levels who regularly scan documents, textbooks, notes, and course materials for studying purposes.

**Key Differentiator:** Advanced AI-powered document enhancement that makes any scan perfectly readable, combined with academic-focused productivity features in a single integrated platform.

## Problem Statement

### Current Problem
University students struggle with messy, blurry scanned documents that are difficult or impossible to read effectively. This fundamental issue creates a cascade of academic challenges.

### Impact
**Primary Impact:** Students cannot study effectively because they cannot read their own scanned notes, textbook pages, or course materials. This directly impacts their ability to:
- Review class materials efficiently
- Prepare for exams with confidence
- Complete assignments using scanned reference materials
- Share clear study materials with classmates

### Why Current Solutions Fail
Existing scanning apps produce low-quality, blurry results that force students to either:
- Re-scan documents multiple times hoping for better quality
- Avoid scanning altogether and risk losing physical materials
- Waste time manually retyping content from unclear scans
- Submit poor-quality work that affects their academic performance

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Solution
**AI-powered document enhancement with smart text recognition** that automatically transforms any blurry, unclear scan into crystal-clear, readable content.

### Technical Approach
- **Advanced AI Enhancement:** Real-time processing that sharpens text, removes shadows, corrects perspective, and optimizes contrast
- **Intelligent Text Recognition:** Convert handwritten notes to typed text automatically while preserving formatting and structure
- **Smart Cropping:** Automatic document edge detection and perfect cropping
- **Integrated Workflow:** Seamless connection between scanning, scheduling, conversion, and AI assistance

### Key Features
1. **ðŸ“„ Smart Scanner:** AI-enhanced document clarity + handwriting-to-text conversion
2. **ðŸ“… Class Schedule Manager:** Scan university timetables â†’ automated schedule with notifications  
3. **ðŸ”„ Format Converter:** Simple conversion between PDF, JPEG, PNG with smart saving
4. **ðŸ¤– AI Chat Assistant:** ChatGPT-style interface with image analysis support for academic help
