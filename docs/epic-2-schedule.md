# Epic 2: Smart Schedule - Brownfield Enhancement

**Epic ID:** Epic-2  
**Priority:** High (Daily Engagement Driver)  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Estimated Stories:** 3  
**Target User:** University Students  
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (Scanner foundation)

---

## Epic Goal

Implement smart schedule management that automatically converts university timetables into intelligent class schedules with proactive notifications, driving daily student engagement and retention.

---

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** Authentication system, dashboard with schedule feature card, document scanning capability from Epic 1
- **Technology stack:** Flutter with Riverpod state management, Supabase (auth/database/storage), GoRouter navigation, Material Design 3
- **Integration points:** Dashboard navigation, document scanner output, notification system, phone calendar integration

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:** Timetable scanning and parsing, automatic schedule creation, smart notifications, calendar integration, and schedule management interface
- **How it integrates:** Uses scanner functionality to capture timetables, leverages Supabase for schedule storage, integrates with device notifications and calendar
- **Success criteria:** >95% schedule parsing accuracy, reliable cross-platform notifications, seamless calendar integration

## User Stories

### Story 1: Timetable Scanning and Auto-Setup
**Priority:** Critical  
**Effort:** High  

**User Story:**
As a university student, I want to scan my printed timetable and have it automatically converted into a digital schedule so that I don't have to manually enter all my class information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Scan university timetable using camera or gallery image
- Extract class information: course name, time, room, professor
- >95% accuracy in schedule data parsing
- Handle various timetable formats and layouts
- Manual editing capability for corrections
- Conflict detection for overlapping classes

### Story 2: Smart Class Notifications
**Priority:** Critical  
**Effort:** Medium  

**User Story:**
As a university student, I want to receive notifications before my classes start so that I never miss a class or arrive late.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Reliable notifications across all app states (background, closed, locked)
- Customizable notification timing (5, 10, 15 minutes before)
- Rich notifications showing class details (name, room, professor)
- Do not disturb integration (respect device settings)
- Notification persistence and reliability testing

### Story 3: Schedule Management and Calendar Integration
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium  

**User Story:**
As a university student, I want to view and manage my class schedule and sync it with my phone's calendar so that all my commitments are in one place.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clean schedule view showing daily and weekly class layouts
- Edit schedule details (time, room, professor)
- Export to device calendar (iOS Calendar, Google Calendar)
- Import from device calendar for additional events
- Schedule conflict resolution interface
- Semester/term management

## Technical Integration Requirements

### Supabase Schema Additions
```sql
-- Class schedules
schedules (id, user_id, semester_id, created_at, updated_at)

-- Individual classes
classes (id, schedule_id, course_name, professor, room, day_of_week, 
         start_time, end_time, created_at, updated_at)

-- Notification preferences
notification_settings (id, user_id, default_minutes_before, enabled, 
                      do_not_disturb_enabled, created_at, updated_at)
```

### Flutter Architecture Integration
- **Feature folder:** `lib/features/schedule/`
- **Providers:** Schedule state, notification management, calendar integration
- **Navigation:** Schedule routes in GoRouter configuration
- **Permissions:** Calendar access, notification permissions

### Platform-Specific Requirements
- **iOS:** Calendar integration via EventKit
- **Android:** Calendar integration via device calendar provider
- **Notifications:** Local notifications with background processing

---

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (auth, scanner integration)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (additive only)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (Material Design 3, consistent navigation)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (efficient notification handling)

---

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **Cross-platform notification reliability** - Notifications might fail on certain devices/OS versions
2. **Timetable parsing accuracy** - Various university formats could cause parsing failures
3. **Calendar permission complexity** - Platform-specific calendar integration challenges

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Notification testing:** Comprehensive testing across iOS/Android versions, fallback notification methods
2. **Parsing flexibility:** Multiple parsing algorithms, manual correction interface, format learning
3. **Permission handling:** Graceful degradation when calendar access denied, clear user guidance

### Rollback Plan
- Disable schedule feature card from dashboard
- Remove notification scheduling
- Revert database migrations
- No impact on scanner or authentication functionality

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified (auth, dashboard, scanner continues working)
- [x] Integration points working correctly (scanner → schedule, dashboard → schedule)
- [x] Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md with schedule commands)
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] >95% timetable parsing accuracy achieved
- [x] Reliable notifications across platforms tested
- [x] Calendar integration working on both iOS and Android
